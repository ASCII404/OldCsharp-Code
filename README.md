# 🔍 Simple OCR Tool (C# WinForms)

This is a basic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) desktop app built in **C# using Windows Forms**. It allows you to upload an image and extract text from it using a simple interface and OCR library.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The UI is outdated and not visually appealing. This project was made a while ago for experimentation and proof of concept.
